Perceptual Calibration Manifesto
================================

Scope
-----
This document is an additive semantic layer for the system.
It does NOT modify runtime behavior, UI, buttons, or existing logic.
Its purpose is to make explicit what the system assumes, measures, and refuses to claim.

Core Position
-------------
1) Perception precedes symbols.
   Intervals, tunings, chords, and nodes are not merely labels; they are perceptual phenomena.

2) No single “correct point”; only stability zones.
   Pitch and interval perception are treated as tolerance zones, not absolute points.

3) Measurement is not judgment.
   Ear Training measures behavior under conditions; it does not assign artistic value.

4) All results are condition-dependent.
   Timbre, loudness, device, attention, and fatigue affect outcomes.
   Interpret results as relative to their measurement conditions.

5) Reproducibility is preferred.
   Randomness must be lockable and describable whenever possible.

Calibration (Definition)
------------------------
Calibration here does not mean “fix the user”.
It means: define the perceptual coordinate system in which measurement is performed.

System Assumptions (Explicit)
-----------------------------
A1. Hearing is primarily comparative, not absolute.
A2. Mid-level loudness tends to yield more stable judgments than extremes.
A3. Timbre and tuning are inseparable (timbre–scale coevolution principle).
A4. Short-term memory decays and is part of what is measured.
A5. Single trials are not meaningful; distributions and trends are.

Ear Training Philosophy
-----------------------
Ear Training in this system is a perceptual sampler, not an exam.

- Interval Zone Training:
  Measures the deviation range in which a listener still identifies an interval as “the same”.

- Spectral Alignment Training:
  Measures perceived stability as a function of timbre–tuning alignment.

- Continuous Pitch Control:
  Measures how a listener stabilizes pitch in a continuous space.

Math / Lattice / VIS Philosophy
-------------------------------
Math and visualization modules generate structural hypotheses.
They are validated by perception, not by mathematical elegance alone.

- Math Tab produces candidate mappings, not final answers.
- Lattice presents relational space, not a doctrine.
- VIS is a navigational aid for perception, not an absolute coordinate system.

On Difficulty, Stability, and Value
-----------------------------------
Difficulty ≠ value.
Stability ≠ beauty.
Instability ≠ error.

Metrics like difficulty/roughness/tension describe perceptual cost, not aesthetic truth.

Non-Goals
---------
- Defining “correct music”
- Enforcing any single tuning system
- Treating Western pitch categories as universal
- Equating mathematical elegance with perceptual validity

Closing Statement
-----------------
Music is not only computed.
It is negotiated between structure and perception.

Calibration is not a cage;
it is a coordinate system for freedom.
